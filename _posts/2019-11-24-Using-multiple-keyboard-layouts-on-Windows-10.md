## Why

C style programming languages are designed in the cultural context of having a English keyboard layout. Programming C style languages on a Swedish keyboard layout is somewhat awkward since you need to exercise finger gymnastics in order to use common characters like `{}\`. Unless you switch to Python the easiest fix is to use multiple keyboard layouts.

## How

I started out by adding English (US) and then Swedish (Sweden) however, I ended up with a long list of keyboard layouts in the keyboard selection that comes up when you press WIN+space. Among those where layouts I couldn't figure out how they ended up there. A coworker helped me out by telling me that what I wanted is to use the English (UK) language but with US keyboard, since otherwise you will end up with additional UK keyboard layouts.

What I wanted was this configuration

but for the UK langauge you add the US keyboard layout that you prefer:

In my case it was the standard US keyboard layout:
