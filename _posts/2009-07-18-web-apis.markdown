### Local procedure calls

Given the scripting nature of the web non-obfuscated JavaScript code presents itself to the technical user almost as a public API. You can try it out yourself by writing:

~~~ JavaScript
for (x in document){console.log(x);}
~~~

in your browser JavaScript console. For more persistent changes to a sites behavior tools like Greasemonkey can be used. Last.fm and Spotify have done some integration by releasing a [Greasemonkey script for last.fm](https://www.spotify.com/blog/archives/2008/12/18/spotify-scrobbles/).

### Remote procedure calls

By using [fiddler](http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/) or Firefox Firebug you can watch the client/server interaction (ajax calls made by a modern web app). The stateless nature of the web and ajax calls promotes a simple design of this "API". This means that programming/scripting against your site can be easily done by, hopefully authorized, users.

### Conclusion

Modern web applications have a natural interface for that might yield a plugin-like api unintended by the applications developers. If you're developing/maintaining a web app, try searching for it on [userscripts](http://userscripts.org/). If your app is used by a wide group of people, then you might be surprised with what you find.
