We have [Scott's method](https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout/wiki/Scott%27s-method). He uses backbone together with knockout. You might want to read the following [google group posts](http://groups.google.com/group/knockoutjs/browse_thread/thread/9a7ad2b44885cf5a?pli=1). I like how you declare your setup on the app object. The problem with using only knockout for creating js app's is that it only focused on view to modelview binding. Also Derick Bailey has made [a comment](http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/11/22/backbone-vs-knockout/) about the curious idea that you choose either knockout or backbone.
