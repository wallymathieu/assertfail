We are waiting for VS2012. What will impact work experience most will probably be the user interface changes as described in:Â [Visual Studio 11 User Interface Updates Coming in RC](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2012/05/08/visual-studio-11-user-interface-updates-coming-in-rc.aspx)

One thing I don't understand is the preference for all caps. The interface is riddles with them. However Richard Banks describes [how-to prevent VS2012 ALL CAPS menus](http://www.richard-banks.org/2012/06/how-to-prevent-visual-studio-2012-all.html), so there might be hope yet.
