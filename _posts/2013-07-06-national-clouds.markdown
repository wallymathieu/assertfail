We first heard of the Australian government gettings <a href="http://delimiter.com.au/2012/04/13/us-slams-australias-on-shore-cloud-fixation/">fallout</a> from the US because of voiced concerns about using offshore cloud providers. Some technologists I have talked with thought it obvious that the US government would use <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/30/nsa-leaks-us-bugging-european-allies">available means</a> to get accurate information given the obsolesce of  certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON">infrastructure</a>. This might spell an increased demand for local alternatives for business software.  Another way is to start deploying software in a more security conscious manner. For instance encrypting the stored information so that the cost of spionage increases.
