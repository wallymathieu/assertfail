We had a small problem with one of the open source components that we use. One of my coworkers had to make a small alteration to that component (he isn't using git at work). The <a href="http://windows.github.com/help.html">github for windows</a> program makes interacting with github very easy on windows. All he had to do was to install the program (easy installation) and clone his fork. Really useful for this kind of work.
