In some settings you might need to access more of the language than available through reflection and System.Linq.Expressions. You might want to look into <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/hh543916">project Roslyn</a> or <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/NRefactory/">NRefactory</a>. These will let you access the C# parser. This can be useful in many settings. For instance, to refactor C#. To render the code to another language.
