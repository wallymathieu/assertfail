For many years we have lived with a move towards the big cloud dragons. In my musings during more than 10 years ago I thought that we would see a move towards national datacenters due to [security implications](https://assertfail.gewalli.se/2013/07/06/national-clouds.html). There did not seem to be a lot pushback from the [CLOUD Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act) in other countries.

The calculations around using US services have changed. [AWS is probably feeling some of the heat](https://www.techzine.eu/blogs/infrastructure/137963/is-the-aws-european-sovereign-cloud-sovereign-enough/) from the disruption in the US government. 

A coworker noticed that the integration goes deeper today than it did 10 years ago. You need an online account in order to use your Windows PC or your Mac. Or it might not have been removed right now, [it is just difficult](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1ak734f/have_microsoft_removed_ability_to_set_up_a_pc/).

Service providers (such as [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/migrate-azure-ad-graph-overview), [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/data-center-end-of-life)) are trying to move away from offering self hosted services. This could simply be because it is a pain (cost) to maintain old branches for old versions of software compared to offering only one version of the software.

It could be that as long as there is a high cost (hiring and reeducation) of moving away from the services offered compared to the alternatives makes transitions unlikely. Significantly higher price or [further cancellations of legitimate business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14203) could change that equation.
