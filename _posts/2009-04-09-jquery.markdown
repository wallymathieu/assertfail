I've come to admire the simplicity and style of jquery. There are some cons to it's approach of using context (as can be seen as this in the for instance "each"):

```js
jQuery("#table tr").each(function(){
    jQuery(this).DoStuffPlugin();
});
```

This wreaks havoc with some object oriented programming techniques:

```js
var classSmurf = function(){
    this.name = "smurfette";
    this.SmurfAround = function(){ alert("Smurf: "+this.name); }
};
```

This is a simplified example that is broken by jquery's use of context. There is a simple work around for this:

```js
var classSmurf = function(){
    this.name = "smurfette";
    var that = this;
    this.SmurfAround = function(){ alert("Smurf: "+that.name); }
};
```

But don't take me wrong. I love jquery. It's really easy to use. A designer (with some css and html knowledge) can learn how to use it. That shows how easy it is to work with.
