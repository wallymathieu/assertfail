> Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic
> environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable
> infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.
>
> These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with
> robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal
> toil.

> The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an
> ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects. We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these
> innovations accessible for everyone.

There is a lot of buzzword bingo around what it means to develop cloud native solutions.
