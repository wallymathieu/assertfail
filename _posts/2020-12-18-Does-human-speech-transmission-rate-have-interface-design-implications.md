Reading the [following summary](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/09/human-speech-may-have-universal-transmission-rate-39-bits-second) around the [article](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/9/eaaw2594) gives food for thought. We also know of [The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/).

If you design an interface (graphical) intended to be used by humans, the amount of information you can put on screen is limited. If you have too much information, people might ignore or disregard parts of your interface. We say that the screen is cluttered. A graphical user interface is similar to spoken language in that you have syntax and grammar that designers tend to gravitate to for the components in order for them to be more easily understood. I think I've noticed that the graphical design language have stabilized during the time that I've used computers (circa 30 years). Design systems such as [Material Design](https://material.io/), [Fluent](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/), as well as [iOS style design](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/cupertino) tell how users will orient themselves through your interface. Compare that to some of the earlier iterations of Web Design. There seems to be some sort of consensus around some of the core concepts that users should be exposed to.

How many bits of information can be displayed on an interface before a human becomes overwhelmed? We have read about the challenges around using [complex interfaces to reduce the amount of human operators](https://gizmodo.com/report-on-2017-destroyer-crash-prompts-navy-to-ditch-to-1837150917).
There is also talk about the trouble around the [amount the information that pilots can process](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeronautics/features/pilot_cognition.html).

The yardstick of having only the relevant information in a GUI relates to the fact that we want humans to not disregard important information when trying to work.
