 - I've found that my coworkers have an easier time grokking React than Angular: React contains fewer concepts than Angular.
 - Angular can sometimes make implementation of custom behaviors require a lot of deep knownledge (of Angular). For instance when implementing custom dropdown or checkbox.
 - If you are cheeky, you could say:
    >Angular is a somewhat over engineered platform, while React is sometimes used to create over engineered apps.

The idea of custom [GUI Widgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_(GUI)) is not new, though the use of functions return values as opposed to side effects was novel to mainstream programming.

My personal opinion is that as long as you can use the existing behavior of the standard components (buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns et.c.), Angular can be a good choice.
