Sounds interesting to hear about the new WinRT api:s for windows. Reading up on it WinRT are COM objects in contrast to the Win32 architecture.
One of the exciting things about this is the promise of being able to use xaml in c++.

An overview of WinRT by Marius Bancila:
[Windows Runtime](http://mariusbancila.ro/blog/2011/09/15/windows-runtime/)

It's quite interesting to read the list on Msdn:
[Windows Runtime and the Windows API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464945(v=VS.85).aspx)

Right now it's probably to early to get a good idea of how everything will look and exactly what features will be accessible for Metro style apps.

Replacing the Win32 api:s is probably an overstatement. I would guess that for some things you might be forced to use older api:s.
