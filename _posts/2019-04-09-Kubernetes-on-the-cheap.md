You can use the fact that Kubernetes allows you to get a stable environment on unstable hardware, so that you can use a bunch of cheap commodity computers to scale your deployments horizontally. A good starting point would be to build your own test cluster.

- Jeff Atwood talks about using co-location in [the cloud is just someone elses computer](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-cloud-is-just-someone-elses-computer/)
- Hanselman tells you [How to Build a Kubernetes Cluster with ARM Raspberry Pi then run .NET Core on OpenFaas](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToBuildAKubernetesClusterWithARMRaspberryPiThenRunNETCoreOnOpenFaas.aspx)

Another approach is to look into where hosted Kubernetes is more affordable than say [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/).
