In the [first post](https://assertfail.gewalli.se/2019/01/06/Choose-your-own-adventure-in-fsharp.html) I introduced some alternatives for F# programming. The title alludes at classic roleplaying games. Mattias Brandewinder has written a [blog post series](https://github.com/mathias-brandewinder/MonsterVault) about writing DnD logic in F# that should be an interesting read in order to follow up on that lead.
