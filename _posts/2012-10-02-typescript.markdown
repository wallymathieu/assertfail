Coffeescript has been heralded as a way to avoid some of the nastiness of JavaScript. Now [Anders Hejlsberg introduces](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Anders-Hejlsberg-Introducing-TypeScript) a new addition to the story: TypeScript. I read this from a pal that [linked to a blog post](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2012/Oct-01.html). The geist of the post is a slight positive note, but the author notes that [IntelliSense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliSense) is missing for editors other than Visual Studio. If the license is good (it's [in Apache license](http://typescript.codeplex.com/license)), the language additions are relevant, there might be people that get some of it to work in [another editor](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2012/10/01/sublime-text-vi-emacs-typescript-enabled.aspx).
