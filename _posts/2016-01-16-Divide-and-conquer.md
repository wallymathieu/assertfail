This approach to programming is not only useful for algorithms, it's also a recurring architectural theme. The current version is called microservices. In unix you have the small command line tools that does one thing well. On a smaller scale it's about splitting your code into several files and then folders. When you have identified a need for a library you might create a nuget, gem, maven or npm package (see [modulecount](http://www.modulecounts.com/)).
