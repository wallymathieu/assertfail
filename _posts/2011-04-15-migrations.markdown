Listening to [herding code on fluent migrator](http://herdingcode.com/?p=233) is quite interesting.

You could read [Getting started with fluent migrator](http://lostechies.com/seanchambers/2011/04/02/fluentmigrator-getting-started/). If you feel the need to contribute there is [fluent migrator on github](https://github.com/schambers/fluentmigrator).
