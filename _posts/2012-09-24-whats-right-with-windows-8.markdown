It's very focused on a selected few tasks: starting games, playing movies... An ipad is conceptually a similar device. You can surf, run certain applications, watch movies, listen to music. The user interface is simple. Most users have no need for the fuss.</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span><br><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To imagine an operating system where you focus on what normal users want to do, you start looking in the windows 8 direction. The start screen reminds of the Xbox.</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span><br><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I got skeptical and confused when I tried windows 8, looked at videos about it. The reason why it felt wrong: Windows 8 is not intended for me. I'm not part of the 95% that abhors complexity. Ordinary user dislike the "to much information" syndrome present for most desktop operating systems.</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span><br><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I have a suspicion that it's not there yet. Maybe when windows 8.3 or windows 9 is released, my mom can use it without getting frustrated. There are just a few things she wants to do:</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Surf the web, pay the bills, read her email, manage spreadsheets, write documents, manage her photos and keep the gigabytes of photos backed up.</span></b>
