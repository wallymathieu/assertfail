For parsing log4j files there are some alternatives:

1. [Chainsaw](http://logging.apache.org/chainsaw/index.html) (java gui). If the links dead, note that it should be part of log4j.
2. Similar to chainsaw but in .net: [logviewer](http://github.com/wallymathieu/log4net-logviewer).
3. [Log2Console](http://log2console.codeplex.com/) looks pretty sweet. It has some positive comments.

On the logviewer page you find a sample configuration for using "log4net.Layout.XmlLayoutSchemaLog4j". Note that the log4net xmllayout should be parse:able by logviewer as well.

Both [NLog](http://nlog-project.org/) and [Log4Net](http://logging.apache.org/log4net/) can log to the log4j layout.
