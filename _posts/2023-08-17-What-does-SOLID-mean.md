## Single-responsibility principle

The problem with this principle is that the definition is open for interpretation. I've worked with people that have a good grasp on how large a class/module or function should be, but the problem is that people have different expectations around what kind responsibility code should have. It is a good thing to keep code focused on one thing, so the principle should be more of a reminder to break out or move code that does not fit.
