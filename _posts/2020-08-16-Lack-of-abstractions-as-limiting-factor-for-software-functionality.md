title: Lack of abstractions as limiting factor for software functionality

In mathematics, the kind of problems you can solve given a certain amount of time are related to available abstractions. Due to the needs of engineering and physics, there has been a development of a multitude of abstractions. Some of these abstractions are applicable in other areas as well. We see the use of derivatives and integration in the market. These tools might not used by all marketplace actors. Financial firms might choose to use more abstract tools such as derivatives in order to make more money. The complexity limits who might use these tools. Some mathematical abstractions have become commonplace in their use, while the knowledge of how to implement them is sparse. Fourier transforms for instance are used for singal processing of audio and video (why almost everyone benefits from them).

The axiom then is that it's more difficult to implement more complex functionality using limited abstractions.

In order to implement complex functionality using simple tools you arrive at approximate solutions in sometimes roundabout ways. Since the algorithms and abstractions are not made clear, the amount of text and information that you need to deal with increases. The number of bugs and potential for error is usually correlated with the number of lines of code.
