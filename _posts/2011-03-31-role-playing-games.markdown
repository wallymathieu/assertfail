In real life you choose what parts to level, what to learn.

As a developer do you choose to level up or are you stuck fighting the same kind of problems without gaining XP?

Â As a developer do you choose to spend your experience:

* Learning to talk to customers
* Learning to work with others
* Learn patterns, how to write prose
* Learn new technologies
* Learn how to write tests
* Learn how to automate tasks (build, installation, et.c.)

This is just a short list. What I mean is that you have a possibility to choose certain skills. Probably you will ignore some of them. You will be mistaken if you think that the rest of the skills does not matter. Knowing what customers talk about matter! Being able to write correct software matter (that is, being able to write tests)! If you have chosen not to learn one of the skills, know that you will need other persons to lean on. You need to treat these people with respect. They are not dumb just because they are focused on parts you have not chosen to focus on.
