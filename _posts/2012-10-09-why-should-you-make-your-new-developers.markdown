The impression I've gotten from working with ruby is that it's generally fun to work with. One of my coworkers who has about a year of experience told me:

> You become happy from working with ruby.

Also, for many tasks it can provide a easier experience than some of the alternatives. Consider the tasks:

- Manage builds or server
- Simple web app

Tools like rake and sinatra are simple enough to help green developers complete the task without drowning in the complexity.

It's the same reasoning behind webmatrix. In webmatrix there is a lot [less focus on unit testing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5953394/is-there-a-unit-testing-capability-with-webmatrix). It's aÂ slightly different perspective, but still centered around [simple fun stuff](http://blog.wekeroad.com/microsoft/someone-hit-their-head).
