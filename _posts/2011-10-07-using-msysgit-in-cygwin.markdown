There are some pitfalls. One for instance is that it starts the editor wrong when running msysgit in the cygwin shell. Naturally I tried specifying different paths and ended up with the following configuration of gitconfig:

```cmd
c:\\cygwin\\home\\wallymathieu\\.gitconfig
```

```ini
[core]
Â  editor = "\\"/c/Program Files (x86)/Vim/vim73/gvim.exe\\""
```
