# About

## Why Assert.Fail?

   `Assert.Fail` was what I added as body when starting to write a test. It is a clean slate. It's the starting point of many tests. It's a clean canvas for your implementation.

## Why am I writing this blog?

  This blog is somewhat a medium to help me formulate my thoughts. I try to write down some of my experiences. If you find anything where I'm mistaken I don't mind being corrected.

### What am I proud of?

There are lots of closed source code that I'm proud of. That code is not visible for others.

The code that you can see that I'm proud of is for example

- [Isop](https://github.com/wallymathieu/isop). Isop has been helpful for many years when implementing console apps. The intent was to provide a controller scheme similar to asp.net MVC but without using inheritance. I've used Isop less and less over the years thanks to Swagger/OpenAPI and auth integration in that API interface.
- [With](https://github.com/wallymathieu/with). With is a library where I've explored some of the possibilities of C#. I've also added helpful extensions to the library. I'm removing parts of the library as more of it is possible to do in C#. It is now obsolete with the introduction of C# 9.
- [Zander](https://github.com/fsprojects/Zander). Implementation of regular expression for matrix information. This is a re-implementation of an old idea.
- [Formik Reimagined](https://github.com/Decerno/formik-reimagined). Formik has some performance issues. I wrote a re-implementation of the Formik API that we needed to use in a project. This library is not needed for very simple forms. Another way would be to use another library such as [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/).
- [F#+](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpplus). I've helped out and put some love into this library. I like how some of the F# code becomes more Python-like thanks to F#+.
