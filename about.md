# About

## Why Assert.Fail?

   `Assert.Fail` was what I added as body when starting to write a test. It is a clean slate. It's the starting point of many tests. It's a clean canvas for your implementation.

## Why am I writing this blog?

  This blog is somewhat a medium to help me formulate my thoughts. I try to write down some of my experiences. If you find anything where I'm mistaken I don't mind being corrected.

### What am I proud of?

There are lots of closed source code that I'm proud of. That code is not visible for others.

The code that you can see that I'm proud of is for example

- [Isop](https://github.com/wallymathieu/isop). Isop has been helpful for many years when implementing console apps. The intent was to provide a controller scheme similar to asp.net MVC but without using inheritance.
- [With](https://github.com/wallymathieu/with). With is a library where I've explored some of the possibilities of c#. I've also added helpful extensions to the library. I'm removing parts of the library as more of it is possible to do in c#.
- [Zander](https://github.com/fsprojects/Zander). Implementation of regular expression for matrix information. This is a reimplementation of an old idea.
